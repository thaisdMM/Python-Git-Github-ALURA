<h1 align="center"> Secret Number Game 🎮 </h1>


This is a simple __game__ where you have to guess a number from **1** to **10**.

You start by _trying a number_ and check if that **number is correct**. The game will indicate if you **guessed correctly**, or if the number is **higher** or **lower**.

If it's not the correct number, you can _try again_ until you get it right using the game's _hints_ about whether the number is higher or lower.
